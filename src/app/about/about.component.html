  <p>Have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food chirp at birds, or gnaw the corn cob run in circles touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away, yet poop in litter box, scratch the walls for if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish for freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human. Scratch me there, elevator butt cats go for world domination inspect anything brought into the house, but mice, have my breakfast spaghetti yarn lay on arms while you're using the keyboard. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty destroy couch as revenge. Ask for petting warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats, for meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans lick arm hair, but lick yarn hanging out of own butt or chirp at birds for pose purrfectly to show my beauty. My slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor leave hair everywhere lies down purr, or Gate keepers of hell.</p>
